  <div class="impact-info">
    <h2>Basic Information of the Typhoon</h2>
    <p>Typhoon Pablo was located in the vicinity of Malaybalay, Bukidnon on December 4, 2012, with maximum sustained winds of 160 kph and gustiness of 195 kph moving west at 20kph. The Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) estimated that Bopha delivered over 240 mm of rainfall near the coast.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="impact-info">
    <h2>Affected Region</h2>
    <p>The affected areas were usually the coastal and low-lying areas where the storm surge occurred. The geographical location of the area affected the severity of the damage, as coastal areas are most vulnerable to the storm surge and high winds caused by the storm. In terms of economic status, the effect of the typhoon was also felt in terms of the potential damage to infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings, which can impact the area's economic output.</p>

This led to severe infrastructural damage and widespread displacement of people. Even after the typhoon, the lack of power, food, water, and loss of homes affected most Filipinos.</p>

  <div class="impact-info">
    <h2>Vulnerability to Typhoons</h2>
    <p>The extent of vulnerability to typhoons varies from location to location and depends on various factors such as geographical location, infrastructure, and social factors such as poverty and access to public services. Coastal and low-lying areas are inherently vulnerable to storm surge, flooding, and high wind speeds associated with typhoons.</p>
